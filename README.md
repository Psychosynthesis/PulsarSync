# PulsarSync

Although Microsoft has buried Atom (which, as we all know, is quite typical for this company - to buy competitors projects and shut them down), the community still continues to develop the project under a different name - [Pulsar](https://pulsar-edit.dev). So it's time to bring new ftp|sftp syncing-package for them.

One of the most useful additions for Atom was `remote-sync`, which for some reason was not updated and did not fix bugs. I fixed his mistakes in order to continue using this add-on, because. it is quite convenient. At the same time I rewrote everything into simple JS.

## So what is it?

PulsarSync let you use SFTP and FTP features inside Pulsar, having the ability to upload and download files directly from Tree-view. PulsarSync is a revision of two projects: `remote-sync` which was abandoned in 2016 and `remote-sync-pro` which fixed some of the bugs of the first package. In my version several bugs have been fixed, and support for keepalive connections has been added.

## Features

- Uploading/downloading files to/from the server
- Monitoring files for external changes and **automatically** uploading - useful for scss/less compiling
- Support for both SCP/SFTP and FTP

## Extras

- Toggle for uploading changes automatically when you save a file
- Define files to be monitored
- Toggle the logs for extra information
- Toggle the hiding and showing of the log panel
- Set custom config name
- Support for native Pulsar Notifications

## Manual installation

If you need to install a package without the package subsystem, make next steps:
- Download / clone this repository to your `/home/user/.atom/packages/pulsar-sync`
- Enter the directory
- Run `ppm install` (in Atom it was `apm`)

Please note that the finish folder must be named exactly "pulsar-sync", because ppm packages (as and `npm` too) don't recognize large and small characters.

## Usage

You can configure PulsarSync by next ways:

### Existing project

#### Via Pulsar (recommended)

1. Right click main project folder
2. Navigate to PulsarSync > Configure
3. Fill in the details / select options
4. Hit save

#### Manually

1. Add a file named `.sync.json` to your project
2. Add/configure with one of the contents below
3. Save the file


## Options

The `.sync.json` in your project root will use these options:
